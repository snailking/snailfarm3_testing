			<a name="info">QUICK START</a><br>
			
			<p>Your goal is to get to 1 million snails.<br>
			<p>Buy your starting snails first, then hatch eggs to grow your nest.</p>
			<p>You can buy and sell eggs from the contract.
			<p>Use various boosts to improve your hatch size. Each boost gives you an extra full size hatch.
			<p>Owning 2 boosts means you get 3 snails per egg when you hatch.
			<p>(It's biology. Trust us.)<br>
			<p>The SpiderQueen, SquirrelDuke and TadpoleOwner are hot potato boosts: only one player can hold them at once.
			<p>The Lettuce, Carrot and Slug are personal boosts. The Lettuce lasts 1 round, the Carrot 3, the Slug is permanent.<br>
			<p>There is another type of eggs you can find: red eggs.
			<p>If you are not the winner at the end of a round, for every 100 snails you own, you will receive 1 red egg.
			<p>The smart contract also puts 300 red eggs on a reverse dutch auction (price lowers as time goes).
			<p>Red eggs can be used like normal eggs but without any ETH cost. Additionally, red eggs are required to claim the SquirrelDuke, the Lettuce or the Snailmaster.<br>
			<p>The Snailmaster is another hot potato and lets you claim part of the ETH of every transaction.
			<p>The Snailmaster requirement halves every round, and doubles whenever claimed.<br>
			<p>Funding the game can be done through buying acorns.
			<p>Acorns have a slightly decreasing price from round to round. On round 0 specifically, acorns are at half price.
			<p>Acorn holders get 10% of the ETH spent proportionally to their number of acorns.
			<p>Acorns cannot be sold or used. Funding the game means receiving dividends forever, however the decreasing price of acorns should ensure share dilution over time.
